These files are the widget builder. An empty folder can be placed in the widget dirctory and the library will create the required files and you just need to edit the form controls with the XML file and the front end output file `display.php`

## Note

Widget folder names **must** 
* be lowercase
* not include spaces
* not include special characters except underscore
